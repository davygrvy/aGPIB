Functions Duitt intO the DM 5010 aIIOw yOu tO Ob-
tain answers that are already prOcessed Or rrected
in a number of ways+ for instance. ohms readings can
 oHset by NULL to take into account Iead resis
tance Any reading can be scaled according tO the
formula (x-b)a: this converts a voltage reading across
a resistor to current if b is set tO ero and a tO the
resistor's ohms vatue. VOItage readings can be re-
tumed in d8 or dBr (dB cOmpared tO a reference).
Just insert the processing command selted from the
command table in this guide intO set-up messages
5ent to the 0M 501 O. An example using the averaging
function  is  shown  in  the  sample  measurement

DM 501O Response to Interface Messages

The following param sequences show various in-
terface messages transmitted to the DM 501O.

The DM 5010 respands to DCL (and SDC if listen
addressed) by clearing its Input and Output Buffers
and any unexecuted testing commands in its Pending
Settings Buffer, along with any errors or events wait-
ing to be reported (except power on)

G triggers a reading in device trigger mode if the
instrument Feceives the message while tisten ad-
drested. It is used with the MODE TRIG and 0T TR IG
commands.

LL0 IOcks Out the operator frOm restoring locaI
(frOnt-paneI) cOntrOl when the instrument is under re-
mote control.

GTL restores lOcaI control if the instrument re-
ceives the message while listen addressed.

cussion of how the instrument responds tO interface
messages.
